If `z-index: 99999;` is something that you write often when you work with CSS, this story is for you. We will see how to handle the `z-index`  property and the stacking context in your CSS.

## Stacking context

This term indicates a three-dimensional conceptualization of the HTML elements that are stacked across the imaginary z-axis, based on some attributes these elements can stack on top of each or inherit properties from their parents.

A practical and common example of this is the CSS `opacity` property. When you apply this property to an element, every child element, at any level, will be rendered with the same opacity level. This property will cause the element to create a stacking context.

Let's see what CSS properties and HTML elements trig a stacking context:

* The `<html>` element
* Element with `position` set to `relative` or `absolute`
* Element with `position` set to `fixed` or `sticky`
* Element that is a child of a `flexbox` or `grid` container
* Element with `opacity` value less than **1**
* Element with `mix-blend-mode` different from `normal`
* Element with `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`, `clip-path`, `mask`, `mask-image`, `mask-border` with a value different from `none`
* Element with `isolation` set to `isolate`
* Element with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling` set to `touch`
* Element with `contain` set to `layout` or `paint`, or keywords that include them, like `contain: strict` and `contain: content`
* Element with `will-change` that specify one of the above properties

While most of the above conditions can be rare, let's take the most common one: an absolute-positioned element inside a container. When we want to set the coordinates of an absolute element and make them relative to a parent boundary we add `position: relative` on that parent element, creating in fact a stacking-context (see the second point above)

You can consider the stacking-context as a **virtual cardboard box** seen from the top, that stacks elements inside it, but with non-solid boundaries.

## Handling z-index

The `z-index` property let you define the position of the element across the Z-axis, inside a stacking context â€” from here referenced as "_box"_. If you take two real cardboard boxes, you know that you can put one on top of each other, and you can put many elements inside each of them. The elements that are inside the upper box will be positioned (or rendered speaking of CSS) above the elements that are inside the underlying box. The only difference is that in CSS, these boxes haven't "solid" boundaries, and elements can overflow outside them.

Here the visual representation of these two boxes, seen from the `CSS` point of view:

In the above image, `.A` and `.B` are our two boxes (stacking-context) and they are siblings inside HTML. The `.B` element is projected and rendered above `.A` cause its `z-index` property, in this case, our `<HTML>` element is the container and the main context holder as stated in the first point of the above list. You can notice that not only `.B` is rendered above `.A`, but also his content. You can imagine `.A > .Two` as a book inside the underling cardboard box, it's above `.One` but still inside the box `.A` speaking in terms of HTML composition.

Here is the visual representation of the same concept, but seen from the top, or in other words, from the user point of view.
