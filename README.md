## Prerequisites

- [Node.js][] & npm
- [Yarn][]

## Usage

You can download the scaffolding to create a new project structure with one command:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/equinusocio/xity-starter
```

This command will download the project to your current working directory and remove the `.github` and `.vscode` folders. After the project structure has been downloaded, you should install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the local development mode

This command will run `parcel` and the local server (with [Browsersync][]) with auto reload.

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Building the production version

To generate your static site/blog you can run the following command. It will prepare the content assets and run optimisations for a production release.

```bash
yarn build
```
